# Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
The goal of the project was to classify each image in the test dataset according to the train dataset results.
The training dataset consists of 6 folders each contains around 2300 images.
The testing dataset contains 3050 images.

1) Report.pdf is the complete discription of the project and the problems that occured during working on it.
2) ResNet-50(91.99%).ipynb is ResNet-50 Neural network model.
3) Sequential (77%).ipynb is Sequential Neural network model.
4) VGG19 (91%).ipynb is VGG19 Neural Network model.

We achieved the highest accuracy using ResNet-50 Model.
